            <h2>Unbox the main stuff</h1>
            <p >
                Take out your PC case, then take out any filling that might be inside. Unbox your motherboard, taking it out properly.
                It is a good idea to set it on top of its box facing up. While you have those two out, next up is your processor and likewise, the pins underneath
                are sensitive, so it is best to avoid touching them. Make sure to grab it by the edges as carefully as possible when taking it out of the box. 
                Take out the heatsink if it came with one. 
            </p>
            <h3>Prepping MoBo and Installing the CPU</h1>
            <p>
                So now that you got that done, you might see a lever on the side of the CPU socket. Lift it. On your processor, you'll see a small golden arrow
                in one of the corners. Match it with that of the CPU socket's. Let the processor drop in place, without applying any pressure.  
                Afterwards, lock the lever back in place.
                On each side, you'll see some plastic braces screwed on the board. Take them out so that the heatsink installs properly. 
                Now every heatsink is different. I suggest looking up a tutorial video on how to install your specific model. Based on the design you should get an idea 
                which way it goes. Some come with pre-applied thermal paste. If it doesn't, then you should apply a pea-sized amount. It is a great heat transferer, cooling 
                the cpu more efficiently. At high temperatures, with no thermal paste it can get dangerously hot and cause problems. Always use it. 
                When screwdriving,
                do it on opposite ends to balance it out and not screw on side too much making the other sides hard to reach the board. Plug in the CPU fan cable into one of the 
                connectors on your motherboard labeled "CPU FAN". 
            </p>
            <h3>RAM installation</h1>
            <p>
                Installing the RAM is not so straightforward. Most people use 2 or 4 sticks of ram. Consult the motherboard manual to check in which slots the ram sticks go into.
                If you have 4, you can insert them in any order. To install, open the clips on opposite sides of the appropriate slots.
                The sticks are keyed, which means they only go
                one way. Make sure the notch in the connectors of the module match with the gap in the motherboard 
                connector. A little force might be necessary so it might feel like you are breaking it but don't worry,
                you will know it is in once you audibly hear the clips latch on.
            </p>
            <h3>Other add-ons and I/O shield</h1>
            <p>
                You might have bought a Solid State Drive that looks like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=m.2+ssd&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">this</a>. It is a good idea to install it at this point.
                Screw it onto the M.2 expansion slot located
                right below the socket and above the PCIe slot. The motherboard package comes with a metal plate called an I/O shield. It goes on the back of the case from 
                the inside. This can be really tricky to install so try readjusting it carefully, making sure it clips in place and facing the right
                way according to your motherboard. You will feel it once it's in.
            </p>
            <h3>Installing Motherboard</h1>
            <p>
                Carefully remove the tempered glass panel from the case. Make sure the case is laid flat on the desk. Next you want to align the backpanel ports section of the
                motherboard with the IO/shield openings while
                gently sliding the board into the case, making sure the screw holes around the edges of the board line up with the standoffs on the case. Then put in the screws included with 
                the motherboard or case. Use good judgement when screwing, you don't want to crack the board due to very tight screwing. Leave the middle hole alone, as that is 
                where the board will rest.
            </p>
            <h3>HDD/SSD</h1>
            <p>
                There are mounts on your case for the purpose of keeping your storage devices in place. Depending on your tower case, they might be behind the back panel, on the base below the motherboard or below
                it in front. Whatever the case may be, you will need to position the drive correctly and screw them with the appropriate screws that came with the case. You'll notice some ports
                in which cables should be plugged into. The smaller, L-shaped port uses a SATA DATA cable. They should have come with the motherboard. Plug one end on your 
                drive and the other into a SATA port on the motherboard. The remaning port connects to the power suppy but before that we need to install it.
            </p>
            <h3>Power Supply and cables</h1>
            <p>
                Depending on what case you bought (usually at the lower back), there is an allocated space for the power supply. Also, depending on the type, you might want
                to check the cables and identify which ones go where. One thing to note, if your PC has a ventilation or dust tray on the bottom, that means the power supply goes fan-side down.
                If you bought a semi-modular, you'll have to plug some cables. The 24-pin cable connects to your 
                24-pin connector on the board. The 8-pin EPS cable goes into the 8-pin connector on the top left. The cable labeled "VGA" is for
                graphics cards. You'll encounter a bizarre-looking cable with many connectors, the SATA Power cable. You will connect one of these 
                into the remaining ports of your storage device to power it. If you have a non-modular type, all the necessary cables should already come out of the unit.
            </p>
            <h3>Graphics card(optional)</h1>
            <p>
                On the backside of the case, remove the necessary expansion slots adjacent to the PCIe slot so that you can insert your graphics card. It may take one or
                two depending on the width of your card. Unscrew and remove them. Insert your graphics card making sure the notches on the golden connectors line up
                with the ones on the board. Like RAM, you'll hear a gratifying click once it is in. Put back the thumbscrews from the brackets in to secure the video card and plug in that VGA 
                cable from the power supply you saw earlier into the card on the correct side, as it only goes one way.  
            </p>
            <h3>Rest of the cables</h1>
            <p>
                Here is a video by <cite>Greg Salazar</cite> that shows how to connect the front panel connectors and all of the cables that are sprawling on the back. This is more of a visual
                task, it's better done by seeing rather than by text.
