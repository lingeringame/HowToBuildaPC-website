                    Many of us might know what a computer is by definition; an electrical device that processes input and produces output. 
                    Computers are used around the entire world. From measuring your heartbeat with a smartwatch to transmission shifting in your car, those devices process data
                    of some sort using 1s and 0s. All of that computing takes place inside the Central Processing Unit(CPU), a small chip which consists of billions of microscopic 
                    transistors systematically embedded to perform millions of calculations per second! Those transistors individually perform operations activated by electrical
                    signals, which results in only two values known as on/off, which can then be represented as 1 and 0 and processed/stored. So everything we use in a 
                    computer whether it be apps, images, videos, video games, you name it, are essentially a bunch of 1s and 0s cleverly processed by the computer. Computers have come
                    a long way since the mid 1900s. To put it in perspective an integrated circuit back in the 1950s only had a few transitors. The Intel 4004, which was a stepping 
                    stone for intel's success in 1971, only had 2250. Now the Apple A13 chip which runs on the Iphone 11, has 8.5 billion! It's smaller and exponentially faster. 
                    Well this ended up being mostly about transistors and the CPU, but that's what makes a computer what it is. There are also other components that a computer can't be without,
                    including the remaining internal components like storage and RAM, and the external components like keyboards or monitors.

                <h1>You want to know the components</h1>
                <p>
                    A computer contains many parts of hardware that might make one feel overwhelmed by their complexity. The truth is, it's not all that complicated and about anyone
                    can build themselves one. Over the years, engineers have worked hard to hide the unnecessary intricacies of a computer and make it more
                    user-friendly so just about anyone can feel comfortable learning about it in this day and age. The <i>Precautions</i> section will guide and tell you the do's
                    and don'ts of building your custom PC. For now, we'll get started on the most important parts.
                </p>
                <h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
                <p>
                    Commonly referred to as the CPU, is the brain of the computer. Without it, a computer is virtually rendered useless. This is where all decisions a computer makes
                    takes place at a microscopic level. The CPU does get hot, so a fan or any cooling mechanism is needed. Stock fans sometimes come equipped with the CPU, but not 
                    always. It's a good idea to invest in a better one though to keep your processor from overheating and at a cool temperature. Right now the most advanced CPU
                     isn't as powerful as a human brain, but it is estimated that withing a few decades it will surpass it.
                </p>
                <h3>Random-Access Memory</h3>
                <p>
                    Also goes by RAM, or memory. RAM temporarily stores data, data that the computer is currently working with. It is volatile, meaning once it loses its access to 
                    power, the data is lost. That is why if you do not save when playing a game or typing a document, it is lost. It's assimilar to human memory. What we are working
                    with is retrieved from our humongous brain bank, then discarded until we think about it again. If you are playing a downloaded movie, the file is 
                    taken from your storage and put inside memory. Then if you open Sony Vegas to edit some footage while the movie is playing simultaneously, the video editing program is loaded
                    on to memory as well. Now you may be wondering why does the computer load it to memory instead of working with it straight from your local storage? Well the answer
                    is speed. RAM is much faster than storage. It allows you to switch tasks quickly without forgetting, in other words "remembering" the tasks you do when you shift to
                    another. It would take a long time if we relied on normal storage drives to do that. RAM is extremely important and without it, loading programs would be excruciatingly
                     slow. Memory capacity isn't as big as your typical hard drive though,
                     so it is a good idea to manage your tasks wisely and not have too many things open, especially heavy applications.

                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                <p>
                    There needs to be a way for these parts to communicate with each other right? That's what the motherboard is for, among many other things like connectivity.
                    Motherboards are sold in different sizes and some only work on certain CPUs. For example, motherboards with LGA 1151 CPU socket types are designed for the current 8th 
                    and 9th Intel Core processors. Alternatively, AM4 sockets only support 2nd/3rd generation AMD Ryzen processors. The chipset, as you can see in the diagram below,  controls
                    and manages data when parts interconnected via the motherboard are communicating. The backpanel includes USB ports (2nd and 3rd Gen), an Ethernet LAN port, HD audio ports like Audio Out, Line In, and Microphone jacks, and also some older
                    ones like VGA ports, or DVI-I for monitors.
                    On the motherboard itself are expansion slots if you so wish to add more parts like a graphics card or SSDs.

                <h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes called the GPU, graphics card, or display card. This is a part specifically for enhancing visual related tasks like displaying images, HD video editing, or
                    video games. These are very popular amongst PC gamers. It's essentially another processor, like the CPU but less powerful, that unloads the tasks dealing with display-purposes
                    from the main CPU onto its own. It also has allocated memory so it doesn't use up all of the system's resources. They also include DVI and HDMI ports on its own backpanel.
                    It's a great addition, and you want to connect your monitors to these if they support said connection types, to get the best out of these beasts.

                <h3>Power supply unit</h3>
                <p>
                    PSU for short, generates electricity to every component inside your machine. There's modular, semi-modular, and non-modular types from modular allowing
                    cables to be attached or detached as needed to non-modular types having the necessary cables pre-attached to the unit. 
                    These come with cables, most in which are connected to the motherboard or storage devices. When choosing a power supply, go a little above your wattage 
                    output, just to be safe and in case you plan on upgrading parts.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <h3>Storage devices</h3>
                <p>
                    You need somewhere to store all of your data right? That's where storage devices come in. A hard drive or hard disk drive is 
                    a container with sturdy magnetic disks that allow read-write functions. These disks can spin up to 10,000 RPM (revolutions per minute). 
                    These are the most common means of storage for computers, given their inexpensiveness and large capacity. Its evolution has come a long way, from storing a few megabytes back in the 80s, to 
                    a portable USB flash drive capable of storing up to 2,000GB (2TB)! Solid state drives or SSDs are newer and getting more common nowadays. It's  smaller
                    and can come in forms like SATA M.2, NVMe M.2 SSD, 2.5 inch SATA, or an AIC (Add-in Card) . They are much faster than hard drives. It uses flash memory instead of the old fashioned 
                    hard drive mechanisms. You can think of it like how RAM data is stored within embedded memory chips, but with SSDs capacity is bigger and is non-volatile, meaning
                    data isn't lost when power is cut off.

                <h3>Tower Case</h3>
                <p>Known as a computer chassis or case, this is where all of your parts will go into, nicely assembled and interconnected. There are 
                various-sized cases, built to fit certain types of motherboards.
