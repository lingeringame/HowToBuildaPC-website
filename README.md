# HowToBuildaPC-website
Website which shows viewers fundamentals of computers and how to build one.
This was my first multipage website I coded and recently I revamped it so that it looks neater and added a mobile version. I enjoy learning about computers and have built one
myself, so I wanted to teach others about what a computer is and how easy it is to build one. This was done by only me. 

Evidently, the main page is index.html. The main styles sheets are styles.css and glitchEffects.css for the glitchy-text effect. There is some embedded CSS to make each webpage work properly. There is some JavaScript that was used to make a trivia, easier 
navigation, and the sliding menu for smaller devices.
